\section{jupyter notebook}
For question two, I used a jupyter notebook to do calculations, and to check my work, the easiest way to see this
is to open the following file in a jupyter notebook(or just look at it on github) \url{https://github.com/NathanRoseCE/ControlsClass/blob/master/HomeworkFour/Untitled.ipynb}

Disclaimer: This is just a few relevant fragments of the source code, as the entire code is a complicated system
that takes these fragments and automatically renders them into the final pdf. However all of this is available
online on \href{https://github.com/NathanRoseCE/ControlsClass}{github}(its latex + python)
