\item Let the STM of the system $\dot {\bar x}(t) = A\bar x(t)$, where $A$ is a constant matrix, be
  $\phi (t, t_0)$. Also, let the STM of the system $\dot {\bar z}(t) = -A^T\bar Z(t)$, where $A^T$ is the
  transpose of $A$, be $\Phi(t, t_0)$. Use the properties of the STM on Slide 39 to show that
  $\Phi(t, t_0) = \phi^T(t, t_0)$.
