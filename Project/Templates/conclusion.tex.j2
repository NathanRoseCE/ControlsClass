\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this was a very hard project, the system being analyzed, that being a doubly-inverted pendulum
being controlled only by a moving pad is incredibly hard and I now have a newfound respect for the videos online
I have seen of people being able to control this system in real life. This difficulty was exasperated by the fact
that as a non-Mechanical engineer, I did not have the requisite background to really be able to take on a problem
of this caliber by myself.

As you are likely to wonder why I did not ask for help during this project, I find that I learn best when I just
sit in my room and just struggle to solve the problem, even if it means that I spend significantly more time on
the project than I would if I asked for help. I have spent an ordinate ammount of time on this project of
constantly running into problems, figuring out my mis-understandings and then solving the issue, this is a
strategy that has worked well for me in the past however for this project, I do feel that it backfired on me a
bit on this project as there are several areas that I fell short on that could have been fixed early on if I
asked for help specifically around equations of motion/state variable selection/linearization. As that could have
resulted in a less complex system that is likely more in line with the expected difficulty of this project, as I
do feel that the complexity was higher than expected.
