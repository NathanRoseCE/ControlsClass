\section{Controller and Observer Design}
\subsection{State and input response}

This system is really complicated and I am unable to find a mathmatical solution to $e^AT$
or $\laplaceinv{(sI-A)^{-1}}$. I even tried to have my computer solve it to no luck
as a result, I am going to plot the response by modeling the system with code required later.
As the system is non-stable it quickly explodes

As this system is massively unstable, I will only be doing simulation runs with zero input(shown again below)
however, the total state response for a less unstable system is achieved by adding the zero state response
with the zero state response for a given input and state.
